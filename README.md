Several of my personal projects

Rubik's Simulator
Description: An Excel program meant to simulate a Rubik's cube.
Status: Completed
Notes:
- All button placed next to the cube's sides will move the Rubik's cube accordingly.
- Scramble will randomize the cube. The cube will always be solvable. The scramble button does not move the center piece of each side.
- Reset will return the cube to a solved position based on the center piece of each side.

Several of my personal projects\
\
Rubik's Simulator\
Description: An Excel program meant to simulate a Rubik's cube.\
Status: Completed\
Notes:
- All button placed next to the cube's sides will move the Rubik's cube accordingly.
- Scramble will randomize the cube. The cube will always be solvable. The scramble button does not move the center piece of each side.
- Reset will return the cube to a solved position based on the center piece of each side.
\
Sudoku Solver\
Description: An Excel program that can solve Sudoku puzzles.\
Status: Completed\
Notes:
- If the puzzle is too hard, the program will stop automatically, putting out a message box telling the user the puzzle is too hard.
- Using sudoku.com as a basis, it can solve up to expert puzzles reliably, master sometimes, but not extreme.
